# TICKstack_pharma4.0
Implementation TICK Stack Architecture for pharma 4.0 using OS Windows 64bit platform. it's more easy to implementing in linux platform or docker, so why implementation this methode on windows platform? based on my experience as OT engineering alway find that standaritation platform OS in manufacturing is windows base. In fact majority OT engineer/automation engineer not familiar with Linux OS. So i hope this repository can guide everyone that want to starting POC this platform.  


## What is TICK Stack ?
The TICK Stack is an acronym for a platform of open source tools built to make collection, storage, graphing, and alerting on time series data incredibly easy. The “I” in TICK stands for InfluxDB. InfluxData provides a Modern Time Series Platform, designed from the ground up to handle metrics and events. InfluxData’s products are based on an open source core. This open source core consists of the projects Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, and Kapacitor—collectively called the TICK Stack.
